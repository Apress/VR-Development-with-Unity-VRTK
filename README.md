# VR-Development-with-Unity-VRTK
VR Development with UnityÂ® VRTK by Christopher Coutinho
This repo contains all Unity package files required to follow along with the book.
It also contains the completed project as a .rar file. 
I would advise to download each unity package individually as and when required. If you download using the github Zip option you wont have access to the files VRTK_Playground.unitypackage and VR_Playground.rar (1.44 GB) as these files are extremely large and have been uploaded to github using Git LFS. As such only a link to these files is downloaded via githubs Zip option.
You will need to click on each of these files indvidually in the main repository where you will note that these files were store using Git LFS. Besides the row entry for the individual file you will see a Download button. Click on it to download the concerned file.
