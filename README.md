# VR-Development-with-Unity-VRTK
VR Development with UnityÂ® VRTK by Christopher Coutinho
This repo contains all Unity package files required to follow along with the book.
It also contains the completed project as a .rar file. 
**********************************
I would advise you to download each unity package file individually as and when prompted within the concerned chapters. If you download all files in one go using the github Zip option you wont have complete access to the files VRTK_Playground.unitypackage (408 MB) and VR_Playground.rar (1.44 GB) as these files are extremely large and have been uploaded to github using Git LFS. As such only a link to these files is downloaded via githubs Zip option.
You will need to click on each of these large files indvidually in the main repository branch, where you will note that these files were stored using Git LFS. Besides the row entry for the individual file you will see a Download button. Click on it to download the concerned file.
