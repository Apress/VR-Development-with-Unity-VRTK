# VR-Development-with-Unity-VRTK
VR Development with UnityÂ® VRTK by Christopher Coutinho
This repo contains all Unity package files required to follow along with the book.
It also contains the completed project as a .rar file. 
**********************************
I would advise you to download each unity package file individually as and when prompted within the concerned chapters. If you download all files in one go using the github Zip option you wont have complete access to the files 'VRTK_Playground.unitypackage' (408 MB) and 'VR_Playground.rar' (1.44 GB) as these files are extremely large and have been uploaded to github using Git LFS. As such only a link to these files is downloaded via githubs Zip option.

You will need to click on each of these large files indvidually within the main branch, where you will note that these files were stored using Git LFS. Upon clicking the file hyperlink name available within the main branch, you will notice that besides the row entry for the individual file, you have access to a Download button. Click on it to download the concerned file. As the above 2 mentioned files are large, your download may take a while to complete.
